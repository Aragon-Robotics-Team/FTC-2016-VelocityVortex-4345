This is the FTC Robot Controller app created by ART 4345 for use in the 2016 FTC game Velocity Vortex.
The core of the app comes from the FTC SDK provided to all teams, and is designed to work in conjunction with the FTC Driver Station app, which is availible through Google Play.
All custom ART subsystems and OpModes can be found in `TeamCode.src.main.java.org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode`.
